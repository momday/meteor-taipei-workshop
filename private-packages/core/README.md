The Core package is where you're defining code common to ALL apps in your suite.

You can definitely have more than just a Core package, for instance if there is a lot of shared code between the admin and services app, they might share a second private package.

The package structure mimics the package structure of a normal meteor app to keep your code organized consistently.
